# Algorithm Anki Set Generator
This project converts a Rubik's Cube algorithm set into an Anki deck for learning.

# How to use the Alg Anki Set Generator

1. Put the name of your algset in the first line of "algs.txt"
2. Put your algs in the other lines of "algs.txt" one alg per line. The moves of the individual algs must be seperated by one space.
3. Run the "main.py" file using Python.
4. Import the generated ".apkg" file into Anki.

# Future Plans
- add an image of the case
- add configuration options
- improve the scramble generator algorithm

**Note that I don't really have much time to develop this, as I myself would also rather learn the algorithms than write a tool for it. So feel free to make changes yourself!**
